Initial script now created for importing KAWA prices into prun-planner.

You can add it to your tampermonkey from 
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Coolfeather2/prunt/tampermonkey/kawa.js

- Open your cx settings page and refresh the page to make sure script is loaded
- A button will appear in the top left button to import KAWA, wait for page to load before pressing
- It only imports Proxion prices into Empire Materials currently, worlds will be done later
- not fully tested/may be jankey
It will take some time to load the price data from https://kawa.dizzy.zone/ and then inputs one by one.
Once the spinner disappears it should have finished running.
